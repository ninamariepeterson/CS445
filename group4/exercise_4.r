# Exercise 4: functions and conditionals

# Define a function `is_twice_as_long` that takes in two character strings, and 
# returns whether or not (e.g., a boolean) the length of one argument is greater
# than or equal to twice the length of the other.
# Hint: compare the length difference to the length of the smaller string
is_twice_as_long <- function(a, b){
  nchar(a) >= (nchar(b) * 2)
}

# Call your `is_twice_as_long` function by passing it different length strings
# to confirm that it works. Make sure to check when _either_ argument is twice
# as long, as well as when neither are!
is_twice_as_long("test", "te")
is_twice_as_long("lol", "lol")
is_twice_as_long("roflcopter", "lol")

# Define a function `describe_difference` that takes in two strings. The
# function should return one of the following sentences as appropriate
#   "Your first string is longer by N characters"
#   "Your second string is longer by N characters"
#   "Your strings are the same length!"
describe_difference <- function(a, b){
  if(nchar(a) == (nchar(b) * 2)){
    print("Your strings are the same length!")
  }else if(nchar(a) > (nchar(b) * 2)){
    print(paste("Your first string is longer by", (nchar(a) - (nchar(b) * 2)), "characters"))
  }else {
    print(paste("Your second string is longer by", ((nchar(b) * 2) - nchar(a)), "characters"))
  }
}

# Call your `describe_difference` function by passing it different length strings
# to confirm that it works. Make sure to check all 3 conditions1
describe_difference("test", "te")
describe_difference("lol", "lol")
describe_difference("roflcopter", "lol")
